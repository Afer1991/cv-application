# CV Application

## Description

The application allows users to create professional resumes by inputting personal information, work experience, education, and more. Users can modify and delete data as needed to update or improve their resumes.

## Motivation

The CV Application project is part of my ongoing self-taught education through The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course. The goal of this project was to introduce me to the React JS framework. While building this project, I've had the opportunity to learn how to use React components, props, and conditional rendering, among other things.

## Quick Start

```
git clone git@github.com:Afer1991/cv-application.git
```
```
cd cv-application
```
```
npm install
```
